    <h1>Posts are ok, but how do I change header links and all theese</h1>
    <p>
      In <code>index.html</code> see the text you want to change. Lets say you wanna change the &quot;Docronym&quot;
      logo text up left. Go to the file and look for &quot;Docronym&quot;. You will find 4 of them
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>The logo text. If you change this, you will get all the animations and stylings for your logo text.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>The title of browser tab</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>The text that comes when you start the page</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Docronym.js for binding file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if you don&#x27;t know html, I think you can guess what
      <code>id=&quot;logoText&quot;&gt;Docronym</code> would mean.
    </p>
    <p>Here is another, <code>&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub</code> - change link, and change name.</p>
    <p>
      A&gt;B isn&#x27;t how HTML work. But if you know this, you don&#x27;t need to look for this, if you don&#x27;t, it
      is enough for changing the links.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&#x27;t afraid to play with code that looks intuitive for you. You can just put this as what this is. You
      don&#x27;t have to.
