      Docronym will take the post files&#x27; names as post names. It will take your posts and show it. No generation,
      or anything is needed. You write your post, put it in the posts folder.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Docronym is pretty light</h3>
    <p>
      Any JavaScript framework isn&#x27;t used. So there is no virtual dom, no compiling into JS. The only library that
      Docronym use is JQuery for fetching your posts. We plan to remove this and find ways to do this in pure
      JavaScript.
