    <h3>No Static HTML generation</h3>
    <p>
      It can take so long when you have so many posts. Docronym doesn&#x27;t auto generates static HTML files. Your
      files stays as what they are, and being served as themselves. If you want to use some HTML generator for your
      specific post, or even for every post, you can use whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can transform your MarkDown or documents into HTML. You are free to use your favorite HTML generator. Even you
      can write pure HTML, not fun tho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any styling, put your files into your posts folder (Dposts is default name). It has its own default
      styling. Didn&#x27;t like? You can modify default or every post&#x27;s style separately, as they are HTML.
