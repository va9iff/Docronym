    <h1>Single page</h1>
    <p>
      It loads only post and injects it to the content. Then keeps it for future. If user clickc the post again, it will
      show this data and won&#x27;t fetch again. All the kept data vanishes when you refresh the page. So the user gets
      the latest data. By this, avoided unnecessary fetches.
