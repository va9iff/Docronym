<h1>How it works</h1>

All you need to do is:
<br />
<br />
<ol>
  <li>html, css and js files in your project (which is planned to be one html file)</li>
  <li>
    make a Dposts folder in you project (which is planned to be optional, so you can put every page to root, or put a
    specific folder)
  </li>
</ol>
<br />
so you are good to go.
<br />

<h1>Customisation</h1>
didn't liked the elegant light green? you can choose the accent hue (well, there is no plenty of themes avaliable yet.
only theme - MonoHu. and you can change its mono hue)
