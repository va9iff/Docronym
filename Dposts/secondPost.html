<h1>No build needed</h1>
when the user visits your website, it just reads the post folder, takes all the names (the post name is its file name),
and shows it.
<br />
<h1>Single page ?</h1>
if the user clicks one of the post names, it will get the file, and injects it into the main page's content part. you
don't go to another page. it's a simple technique but quite powerfull
<br />
<h1>No framework downside</h1>
everything is pure javascript (and JQUERY). so it has to be blazing fast.
