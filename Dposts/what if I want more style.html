<title>I want more style</title>

the core of this framework is its simplicity in implementation way and overall <b>simplicity</b>. shows you can make a
documentation so easy. it has some style tho. if you don't like, you are free to change css. but it is recommended to
not breake html structure. use html to add link or logo in the way this page does.
